Guidelines for names (https://developers.google.com/style/filenames)
Make file and directory names lowercase, with the occasional exception for consistency, to make file searches easier and search results more useful. For example, because most Unix-style operating systems are case sensitive, they can't find a file named Impersonate-Service-Accounts.html if you search for impersonate-service-accounts.html. Linux and macOS interpret these as two distinct files.

Use hyphens, not underscores, to separate words—for example, query-data.html. Search engines interpret hyphens in file and directory names as spaces between words. Underscores are generally not recognized, meaning that their presence can negatively affect SEO.

Use only standard ASCII alphanumeric characters in file and directory names.

Don't use generic page names such as document1.html.

exceptions
It's okay to have some inconsistency in filenames if it can't otherwise be avoided. For example, sometimes tools that generate reference documentation produce filenames based on different style requirements or based on the design and naming conventions of the product or API itself. In those cases, it's okay to make exceptions for those files.
