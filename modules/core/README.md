## What is this?

Starwards is a space and starship simulator designed specifically for LARPs (Live Action Role-Playing games). Derived from the "Starship Bridge Simulator" genre, Starwards is designed to support long games where the players interact with the ship's system throughout the ship, not just in the bridge.

This is the core logic and client of Starwards, published as a library.
