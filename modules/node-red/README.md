# What is this?

Starwards nodes for Node-RED.

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.

[Starwards](https://github.com/starwards/starwards) is a space and starship simulator designed specifically for LARPs (Live Action Role-Playing games).

This package adds Starwards server API to the Node-RED echosystem. This is the way to integrate starwards with anything that is supported by Node-RED: Dashboards, MQTT, DMX etc.

# how to run and use it

Only Nove-RED version 1 and above is supported.

Use the following command from within your user data directory (by default, `$HOME/.node-red`):

```
npm install @starwards/node-red
```
