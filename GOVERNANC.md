# Overview

This project (Starwards) is owned and led by a benevolent dictator (Amir Arad) and managed by the community. That is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the general strategic line is drawn by the benevolent dictator. In case of disagreement, he has the last word. It is the benevolent dictator’s job to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community’s job to guide the decisions of the benevolent dictator through active engagement and contribution.

# Principles

The community adheres to the following principles:

-   Open: Starwards is open source.
-   Welcoming and respectful: See Code of Conduct, below.
-   Transparent and accessible: Work and collaboration should be done in public.
-   Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives and design principles.

# Code of Conduct

Be kind to other people. Don't be rude. Follow the [code of conduct].

# Organization Members

Members of the Starwards organization are empowered to make decisions for the project. Individual members are trusted to make decisions on their own and to bring larger and more controversial decisions to be decided by the benevolent dictator.

# Making Largeer Decisions

Decisions that should always be brought to the benevolent dictator include:

-   Adding new members to the organization
-   Removing existing members from the organization
-   Any decision involving money or finances, ownership etc.
-   Collaborations with outside organizations
-   Strategic community, brand, product or technical decisions

When such decisions are brought to the benevolent dictator, he will present them to the full quorum of members. In the quorum we would like to hear all the voices and dissenting opinions on the decision at hand. Ideally, we would then decide on a course of action by consensus.

If consensus cannot be reached, the benevolent dictator will provide the final word on the decision.
