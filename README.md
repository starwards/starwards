# What is this?

Starwards is a space and starship simulator designed specifically for LARPs (Live Action Role-Playing games). Derived from the "Starship Bridge Simulator" genre, Starwards is designed to support long games where the players interact with the ship's system throughout the ship, not just in the bridge.

# how to run and use it

Currently executables are being built in [circleci](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/starwards/starwards?branch=master&filter=build&status=none&status=success) after every change. download and run the executable.

This is not a solution we like. We are [open to improvements and suggestions](https://github.com/starwards/starwards/issues/832).
